# pokemongo-api

> A [GraphQL][gql] API for [Pokemon GO][pogo] built using data from mining the
> `GAME_MASTER` file. This is currently a WIP, but will eventually be deployed
> publicly to allow developers to build their own tools/apps for Pokemon GO
> without needing to keep up with changes to this data themselves.
